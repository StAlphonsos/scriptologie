These are scripts from my bag of tricks that I've found useful over
time.  Some of them are from a long time ago and my coding style has
changed over time, so they are a bit uneven stylistically.

Feel free to bug me about them.  They are all released under a
2-clause BSD license, present in this repo.

I keep libraries in lib and scripts in bin.  All Perl sources have
PODs of some kind.

Scripts in ths collection:

* tomboy2org.pl - translate Tomboy/GNote-style XML notes into org-mode
