These are scripts from my bag of tricks that I've found useful over
time.  Some of them are from a long time ago and my coding style has
changed over time, so they are a bit uneven stylistically.

Feel free to bug me about them.  They are all released under a
2-clause BSD license, present in this repo.

I keep libraries in lib and scripts in scripts.  All Perl sources have
PODs of some kind.  Libraries generally use Makefile.PL.  I will
probably change all of this over time.

Scripts include:

* tomboy2org.pl - Translate Tomboy/GNote-style XML notes into org-mode

Libraries include:

* Org - Native Perl interface to the Emacs org-mode text file format
